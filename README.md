# My-Portfolio

For this project I created a portfolio page for myself from scratch. It includes sections about me, my work, my contact, and my resume. As I dont have much to be able to put into the portfolio quite yet, most of the content is just placeholders.

Here is a screen shot of the page: ![](https://github.com/CAHuie/My-Portfolio/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-15%20at%201.30.45%20PM.png)
